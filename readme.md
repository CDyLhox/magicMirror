## hello

welkome to the magic mirror repo. this is where Cas, Friso, and I are creating the worlds very first magic mirror which doesnt work yet. have you seen anyone try anything like this before? i love mark zucherberg. and anyways, in the folder MagicMirrorI2S1 you will find the arduino file, its made using a teensy 4.0 and a teensy audio shield but who knows what else could run it.

# bye
